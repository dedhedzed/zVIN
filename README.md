## üöó ‚ùì What is a VIN? ‚ùì üöó

A VIN, or *Vehicle Identification Number*, is a (since 1981) 17-digit number required on **every** vehicle sold ***ever***. [A typical](https://www.iso.org/standard/52200.html "ISO 3779") VIN will fall under this structure:

![vin-chart](https://github.com/dedhedzed/zVIN/assets/106502744/9e34fe8b-60e9-498a-ad83-b30f13b11dec)

The **3rd digit** will ***always*** be a **9** if the manufacturer makes/sells ***less*** than a certain amount of vehicles. In the EU, this is **500 vehicles.** In North America, we're looking at **2,000 vehicles**.

The **9th digit** is ***always*** a check digit on vehicles sold in the United States and Canada; on vehicles sold elsewhere, it will fall under the **vehicle attributes**. 

The **10th and 11th digits** give information as to what model year and plant the vehicle has been assembled in only for **North American VINs**. In Europe, it would be a part of [***the clear identification of a particular vehicle***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number#Components) section ~~fuckin~~ thing.

Unless the number of produced vehicles is ***under 2000 units a year***, digits **12 to 17** are **ALWAYS** a ***sequential number***, aka what number it has on the production line. For example, if your sequential number is **002161**, your car is the **2161st** one to have rolled off the assembly line. In cases where the manufacturer produces **less** or **exactly** 2 thousand units, digits **12 to 14** are a ***manufacturer identifier***.

## ‚ùì üß† Why make this? :brain: ‚ùì

Well, ~~fuck you, that's why~~ the Flipper Zero happens to be a ***pretty decently sized and capable*** device that **MANY** mafuckas have as a part of their EDC (me included). Something this small and discreet can easily be used to stealthily or conveniently, depending on the assignment/use, **decode and save decoded VIN numbers**, amongst other things. Since decoding a VIN isn't necessarily *too* hard, but most services out there are **online only** or **require a smart phone** to use, having something local and **guaranteed** not to log anything (unless you ***choose to save a decoded VIN!***) is an interesting take on the whole VIN decoding thing.
